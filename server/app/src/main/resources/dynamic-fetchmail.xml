<!-- above. This block is disabled by default.                              -->

<!-- Setting markseen="true" will have no effect on many POP3 servers as the POP3 -->
<!-- protocol does not require the markSeen flag to be supported. When this is the -->
<!-- case, the only way to ensure that messages are fetched just once is to delete -->
<!-- fetched messages from the server with leaveonserver="false". -->
   
<!-- If you want to perform mailet processing on messages fetched by fetchmail, -->
<!-- use the HasMailAttribute matcher to detect messages with the MailAttribute -->
<!-- org.apache.james.fetchmail.taskName. The attribute's value is that of the -->
<!-- fetch task's name parameter described below. -->
